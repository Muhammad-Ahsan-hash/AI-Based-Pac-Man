1. **Install Python 3.9+** and ensure `pip` is available.
2. **Install dependencies.**  The game requires `pygame` for graphics and `tkinter` for the GUI.  On most Linux distributions `tkinter` is provided by the system package manager (e.g. `apt install python3‑tk`).  Use `pip` to install the remaining packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame pandas
   ```

3. **Run the game.**  Navigate into the `pacman_deployment` directory and execute:

   ```bash
   python3 PAC‑MAN.py
